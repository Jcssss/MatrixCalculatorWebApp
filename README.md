# Matrix Calculator
A responsive matrix calculator, designed using React JS, that reduces a matrix of any size into Reduced Row Eschelon Form by using Gaussian Elimination. 

The calculator is currently hosted using github-pages. The full website can be viewed [here](https://jcssss.github.io/MatrixCalculatorWebApp/).

# About
I originally programmed the calculator in python. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Jcssss/Matrix-Calculator).

About a year after I programmed the original calculator, I decided that I wanted to create a more user-friendly and accessible design for the calculator. As a result, I re-wrote the calculator using Javascript. 

Eventually, I'd like to add the ability to...
1. Multiply Matrices
2. Solve for the Eigen Values of a Matrix
3. Solve for the determinant of a Matrix
